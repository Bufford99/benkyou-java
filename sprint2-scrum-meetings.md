## Scrum Meetings
The team is to meet for 10 days during the two-week sprint - 5 meetings per week. You must decide on a time to record your answers to the questions and then a single commit of the day's responses is to be made into your project repository for that day.

|            | Joey Luck | client meeting and team meeting discussing our plan | came up with hints for elementary programming questions | hints for elementary programming and some for selections | finished creating hints for Selections and some for mathematical functions characters and strings | finished creating hints for mathematical functions section
|            | Bufford Sta Maria | client meeting, met with team to plan sprint 2 | created a Library class that will contain all the questions its answer choices, implemented the QuestionActivity so that it goes through each questions and show the results | implemented a feature so that when clicking a lesson button from the homepage, then it will send the level and lesson data to the next activities, letting them know what information to retrieve from the Library class | rest day, but looked a bit into how to forgot email | TDD used to create an AnswerChoice class and integrated it into the Library class and QuestionActivity
|            | Hassan Alvi | Planned sprint 2 - when to have certain things done by | Continued work on abstract class, planned future questions design | worked on sample question and abstract class | studied how to randomize questions | worked on implementing right/wrong answer color changes
| What will you accomplish before the next meeting? | Veronica Moritz | understanding how to randomize answers and dialog boxes | have the sections figured out and on the home page | Break down of questions for level two | Level 3 | Level 4
|            | Joey Luck | research into randomizing answers | complete hints other sections | finish hints on selections | finish creating the hints for mathematical functions characters and strings | create loop hints
|            | Bufford Sta Maria | figure out how to do the questions, and do it so that there’s only one question activity | figure out how to pass data from one activity to another so that QuestionActivity knows which question set to use | fix merge conflicts before merging my branch to master | fix merge conflicts before merging my branch to master, and start helping with questions | fix merge conflicts before merging my branch to master, and start helping with questions
|            | Hassan Alvi | Research into randomizing answer choices | Implement more questions | finish abstract class | finish learning about randomization | finish editing methods

|            | Joey Luck | none | none | some questions are hard to give hints to | learned some Math. Functions | learned and brushed up on a few things about strings and chars
|            | Bufford Sta Maria | how to make radio buttons and group them | RadioGroup and RadioButton usage | I learned how to pass data from one activity to another | firebase does not have a forgot email feature, so we might have to implement our own way of doing it | none
|            | Hassan Alvi | how to make radio buttons and group them | Easier to put questions into one class rather than one class for each question | can only extend one class | none |none
